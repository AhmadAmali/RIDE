# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

**Core value:** Turn any financial regulatory document into approved, system-mapped business action items through a transparent AI pipeline with two human-in-the-loop gates — so compliance never becomes a black box.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Two HITL gates used as natural delivery boundaries — legal gate closes Phase 3, engineering gate closes Phase 4
- [Research]: Commit to Claude structured output Pattern A (source_quote in schema) — structured output + Citations API cannot be combined (400 error)
- [Research]: pymupdf4llm AGPL license is acceptable for closed-source portfolio prototype — flag in architecture docs
- [Research]: Kafka in single-node KRaft mode (no Zookeeper) — reduces operational complexity for prototype

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Demo regulatory document must be selected and validated before Phase 2 begins — document choice affects extraction schema design and prompt engineering
- [Phase 2]: Claude structured output schema and quote-first extraction prompting need Workbench validation before writing the extraction worker
- [Phase 3]: RAG chunking strategy for technical service documentation needs validation — target >80% retrieval precision before wiring to Kafka
- [Phase 4]: Engineering gate UX for displaying RAG retrieval evidence per suggestion has limited prior art — may need design iteration
